# Flags

Battman shows the raw gas‑gauge flags reported by the battery gas‑gauge IC. These bits come directly from Texas Instruments gauges (bq274xx, bq275xx, bq20zxx) and are rendered in the **Flags** row of the Battery Info table as two bytes (High and Low).

## What you see in the app

- A hex value (e.g., `0x00CC`) shows the combined 16-bit flag word.
- Two segmented rows display the bits: the top row is the high byte, the bottom row is the low byte.
- A filled/bright segment means the bit is set; dim means clear.

## How Battman maps flags

- If the gauge model is known (from device name or board target), Battman loads the matching TI flag layout; otherwise it guesses a close layout.
- Bits are presented in two rows. Selected segments indicate set bits.
- Meanings follow the TI datasheets; key fields are summarized below.

## Notes

- Flag layouts mirror TI documentation; consult the specific datasheet for thresholds and timing.
- Battman displays flags read-only. Interpretation depends on charger state and the OEM thresholds. If flags consistently look wrong, the pack or gauge may be misreporting.
